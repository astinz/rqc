\section{Motivation and vision}
\textbf{The first quantum computers are already able to solve simple problems, but still suffer from a high
probability of errors. A so-called quantum advantage - i.e. the solution of an application-relevant
problem with an efficiency that a classic computer can never achieve - will only be achieved in the
medium or long term. Today, providers of quantum computing systems are almost exclusively located in
North America, closely followed by Chinese government initiatives. There are other strong groups in
Japan and Australia, among others. Therefore, we in Germany and Europe have to set up a suitable
structure in the short term (in the next five years) in order to develop, build and operate a complete
quantum computer system with quantum applications and thus ensure sovereign access to this
potentially disruptive technology. Quantum computer systems are to be understood holistically. This
means that both hardware and software down to the application level are integral parts of such an
overall system. In addition, researchers and users should have access to existing systems in order to pick
up speed and continuously compare expectations with regard to quantum computing with reality.

\section{Challenges and solutions}
\textbf{Although some of the numerous technology platforms are currently well ahead in development,
In the long term, it is not yet possible to predict which technology will be the most effective. That is why it
also applies for a long time

Ions\\
Quantum computers based on ion traps are
next to the superconducting approaches the furthest
developed technology platform. With similar
System sizes and gate quality as with the superconductors
can already be performed with quantum simulations. The
cornerstone for the development was made
initially laid using large Paul traps,
in the meantime, however, scalable chip-based approaches
are being pursued. Germany is already in this field
well positioned for years.\\\\

Neutral atoms\\
Neutral atoms form another interesting platform for
realizing a quantum computer. Included
are atoms in optical tweezers or optical
Trapped in bars. Up to a hundred qubits can be created in
this way

grades are still behind those of the

The first start-ups are already active in this area.
Germany is well positioned here in terms of research.\\\\

Spin qubits\\
Spin-based approaches can be eliminated through
imperfections

Realize semiconductor structures. In terms of their
technological maturity, these systems are currently well
behind
the ion trap and superconductor approaches. They contain
only a few qubits, but often with excellent gate quality. As a
huge advantage, especially with
silicon-based approaches are very similar
to classic hardware, so that the experience of the
Semiconductor industry for scaling these systems
can be used. Germany has both in the area of
Nitrogen vacancy centers as

approaches.\\\\

Photons\\
Photonic approaches use the
Quantum states of light and

Boson sampling with 76 photons was demonstrated
and thus quantum superiority for an academic one

Beyond the technology platforms, it will be crucial to have skills
in quantum information theory, algorithms, software and

to expand. Here Germany is in research and
Industry in an excellent starting position.\\\\

\subsection { Status quo and challenges}
It follows from the various possible approaches
the uncertainty as to which technology it ends up being

both the time horizon and the specific benefit

assessable. The consequence is an even more cautious one
Commitment - on both the provider and the user side. As of
today there are in Europe
nobody who approaches the development of quantum
computers holistically and with the actors
from the USA and China on an equal footing
could act. In order to successfully implement the “quantum
computer made in Germany strategy”,
we therefore master some challenges.\\\\

Also the position of Germany and Europe is with
Intellectual property (IP) in the area of quantum computing weak. A
solid base for backup
the freedom to operate is missing. There is also only
restricted access to quantum computers, especially at the
hardware level, so that a targeted

components as well as a validation of the potential are hardly possible

Talent drain, particularly to the US. Germany
and Europe are in competition for the best minds
and companies back.\\\\


Based on the analysis of the status quo, we determine:\\\\
\begin{itemize}
\item In Germany are to a considerable extent relevant
skills and know-how available. However, these
are widely distributed and not yet economically
oriented. Neither individual actors nor existing
consortia are now able to provide the To tackle
the development, construction and operation of
quantum computers. In order to be successful,
we need to use our forces in a holistic way
Bundling ecosystems and coordinating activities.
To this end, strong European partners involved
and national with European measures are
coordinated.

\item It is currently not foreseeable which technology
platform will ultimately prevail. Different
approaches must therefore initially be carried out
in parallel be followed up before further focusing
the resources can be carried out in a wellfounded manner.\\\\
\end{itemize}

This results in the following recommendations for action:\\\\

\begin{itemize}
\item the establishment of hubs with the aim
of realizing complete quantum
computer systems based on at least
one technology platform. In addition,
the essential economic, university and
scientific competence carriers involved
in the areas of hardware and software the. The hubs are intended to offer high-quality training and
further education, promote the generation of intellectual property,
establish and integrate start-ups,
Industry and science quantum computers
provide and technology-specific
Develop applications together. they form
the nucleus for future system integrators
and providers as well as points of contact for a
European cooperation.
\begin{itemize}
\item the establishment of intermediate network structures
(competence networks), the specific cross-hub topics in
transverse Fields such as quantum software and applications,
systemically relevant technological infrastructure as well
Address training and further education and link the activities
of the hubs
\item the establishment of an interagency Umbrella organization -
the German Quantum Community (DQG) - for selection,
evaluation for gradual concentration and coordination the
overall strategy with the involvement of a European
committee of experts responsible for all evaluation questions\\\\

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Auf diese Weise schaffen wir eine hohe Sichtbarkeit
und feste Anlaufstellen, um auf dem Weg weitere
Akteure einzubinden. Gleichzeitig bieten wir sowohl
der Industrie und insbesondere Start-ups (Zulieferer,
Systemintegratoren, Lösungsanbieter, Software- und

\subsection{Recommendations for action and
competitive criteria}
We recommend a competition to build quantum computer
systems in focused structures -the hubs - to orchestrate. The
choice of hubs is intendedwith the participation of an
external, with European,internationally recognized experts
who are linked to the umbrella organization Strategy
Advisory Board based on objective criteria. These are also
used for regular, annual Evaluation in order to achieve a
further concentration on the most promising technology
platforms and hubs in the medium term. Also the
competence networks for infrastructure, application and
training must be established in a competitive process and
specified for the respective area Fulfill criteria.\\\\

\subsubsection{Classification of the technology platforms according
to challenges: "quantum advantage" or "scalability"
}
To have a focus and at the same time a certain
\vfill\null
Enabling technology openness is due to different stages of
development a differentiation in the technology goals
necessary. Every Platform as part of a hub should therefore
when submitting an application according to their
technological maturity classify and regarding the
international status position based on the following
parameters:\\\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Number of qubits
\item Set and type of tags or interactions /Operations
\item Quality of operations (errors per tag or per time unit)
\item Connectivity
\item proven potential for error correction or error avoidance\\\\\\

\end{itemize}

The "quantum advantage" category promises within
specific problems over a period of five years faster and
more efficient than existing classic ones Computer solve.
You have to do this right from the start the implementation
of quantum algorithms for the physical platform used
(international) have been proven. Within five years,
applicants must have a quantum advantage demonstrate a
quantum computer system of the hub. The system should
be based on at least 500 qubits be designed and at least 100
individually have addressable qubits.\\\\

In the “Scalability” category, the same Period of at least the
implementation of Quantum algorithms shown on a

\subsubsection{Software and applications}
Software and applications must provide all functionalities in
order for the im the objectives mentioned in the previous
section to enable:

\begin{itemize}
\item practical and industrial applicability that offers a
quantum advantage
\item Development of algorithms and informationtheoretical concepts with provable Quantum
advantage
\item Development methodology, development tools and
cloud execution environment. An evaluation is based
on the number of users of the cloud environment or
use of the Development tools mainly through
external ones Users
\item  clearly defined interfaces to third party providers To
allow technology access to the various technology
levels (e.g. pulse level, Firmware, middleware,
application level). the Evaluation is based on the
optimized utilization of hardware resources
\item Access to applications and software via (cloud-based)
interfaces (in the sense of platform/software-as-aservice - PaaS / SaaS) to a broad basis for application
development
\end{itemize}

\columnbreak

\subsubsection{Infrastructure}
Access to the necessary infrastructure such as production
lines or cloud access is a must either already exist or during
the Project can be built. The infrastructure must also be
used by other interested parties like industry and research
groups to be fair and provided in transparent terms (Open
Innovation and Testing Labs).\\\\

\subsubsection{Economic implementation}
An IP development strategy must be presented, whose
Implementation is assessed based on the number of
patents accepted. A concept is also needed
for the active promotion of company spin-offs, for example
through start-up centers or incubators, as well as for
establishing a system provider.
The share of private capital in the form of own
contributions to the total funds also serves as an evaluation
criterion for the applications and enables under
among other things an intrinsic focus on relevant
Fields of application.

In addition, it must be shown how technology sovereignty
is promoted and - depending on the Technology status -
to be achieved in the medium term can. This also includes
naming the necessary ones and critical components and
competencies that are available in Germany and Europe
or must be built up (see Page 28 ff.). In particular, it must
be shown how a possible, very critical use of funds for
services from non-European providers as a direct hub
competitor continuously is reduced. Here is a regular
(annual) Review and approval after assessment by the
Strategy Advisory Board is required.\\\\

\subsubsection{Education and Society}
The training strategy is also assessed from skilled workers to
further training opportunities in the or for the economy as
well as for Public relations with the aim of long-term
Establishment of quantum technologies in society. That also
requires a concept for Responsible Research and Innovation
(RRI) respectively Technology assessment. Furthermore, the
promotion of the next generation in science and business
evaluate and present a sustainable strategy for equality and
diversity.\\\\

In order to establish an efficient transfer from basic research
and applied science to industrial applications in the medium
term, must be the experts from science and Research can be
involved at an early stage without losing the excellent
research by building new ones to weaken structures.

\subsection{Quick start and staying power}
The world is not waiting for Germany. The proposed
measures must take effect quickly. Hence the organization
proposed here Designed to work with existing instruments
can be implemented immediately (similar to, for example,
the Measures of the top or excellence clusters) to then to
consolidate into longer-term structures after an initial start
up phase.\\\\

The first step is a bid for hubs and Competence networks
taking into account prepared according to the specifications
of the Expert Council and by the responsible ministries in the
first quarter of 2021 should be carried out. In parallel, the one
below must described umbrella organization to be established
to accompany and supervise the selection with it the hubs can
start operating in 2021. The further steps can then follow,
such as such as the establishment of the hub association and
the consolidation of the entire structure by 2024.

\subsection{Hubs: selection, structure, properties and content}

In a competitive process, \textbf{some a few hubs} are selected. It
doesn't go in first and foremost about the competition of
individual actors, it's about bringing the best players
together to form hubs. On the one hand, this ensures the
necessary focus in Germany and, on the other hand, a
critical one Measures for international competitiveness and
Technology leadership. The selection and evaluation criteria
are shown on page 15 ff.\\\\

A hub contains at least one technology platform for the
construction and operation of a quantum computer system
and provides the necessary software levels (Control software,
firmware via middleware up to Application level) ready for
operation and access and enables access for users via a
Cloud service in cooperation with the user competence
network and provides access to system-relevant
infrastructure and a training structure secure. This avoids
multiple developments and paves the way for a quantum
software industry. Depending on existing in Germany /
Europe A hub can be localized or organized in a delocalized
manner. To strengthen the In line with the idea of
competition, several hubs can be added to a technology
platform provided that clear differentiation features are
available and complete quantum computer systems are 
addressed in each case. To be strived for an amalgamation
of the best and an increasing focus on the most promising
approaches. For the emergence of innovations a local
proximity of the actors involved can be advantageous.\\\\

In addition, each hub includes a \textbf{steering committee with
strategic competence and responsibility} (perspective
decision-making power), which consists of Is composed of
representatives from both science and industry.\\\\

A hub has access to or creates the necessary infrastructure
to provide the hardware and software. In addition, it
makes a contribution to the training of the required
experts, among other things by imparting knowledge in
hardware and Software (develop common language) as
well by building up assessment competencies for Possible
applications. This is coordinated through the respective
competence networks. The hub also acts as an \textbf{incubator
for spin-offs and start-ups} in close cooperation with
Industry and existing offerings. The goal is Creating an
ecosystem in which start-ups and potential system
integrators can arise or grow. The hubs, which are initially
organized on a decentralized basis, are to be used for
system integration increasingly also be spatially focused.\\\\


\textbf{Long-term secured funding for the hubs
is indispensable} (similar to, for example, the
Promotion of clusters of excellence) in order to ensure
sustainable, effective action. In addition to basic financing,
this is intended to be a flexible instrument
funding selected by the hub to carry out external
applications with competitive
Allocation should be provided (similar to, for example, the
Funding of clusters of excellence or in the program
Twenty20 of the BMBF). A financial contribution from
the industry is fundamentally a prerequisite for

a long-term alignment of the activities must the
development of quantum computer systems in suitable
operator models, which are to be worked out within the hub
structures.

\subsection{Competence networks}

The main task of the competence networks is to address
overarching thematic priorities
and the activities of the hubs among themselves as well
with industry and external users and
Bringing educational institutions together. The
competence networks should also be based on the hubs
selected in a competitive process will. The selection and
evaluation criteria are listed on page 15 ff. There should be
duplications can be avoided between competence networks.
In particular, we recommend activities of the countries in to
involve the competence networks.\\\\
\columnbreak

A competence network coordinates one at a time cross-hub
subject area, especially in the key fields of training,
infrastructure and Applications, and provides starting
points for this for the hubs as well as the necessary financial
and human resources available. It bundles the expertise
available in Germany / Europe and Competence and acts as
the first point of contact for external users and stakeholders.
In addition, the network provides coordinated standards
their creation, guarantees compliance with recognized
Quality criteria and provides in coordination with the
Strategic Advisory Board ensures that there are no
unwanted ones Duplication comes.\\\\

The competence networks have their own project funds to
carry out complementary development activities in in close
coordination with the hubs. she operate along self-defined
milestones as well the objectives of a steering committee. In
doing so, the most relevant for the respective network will be
Actors from business, science and the public Hand as well as
representatives of the hubs.

\end{multicols}

\newpage
They promote the involvement of startups and companies,
for example in the development of software tools,
consulting services, Applications and training programs,
and ensure that these are on the infrastructures of the hubs
can access.\\\\

\textbf{Examples of competence networks}\\\\
The three following competence networks are presented as
an example and can be agreed upon be strategically
completed with the DQG.\\\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item Quantum Computing User Skills
Network\\\\

The Quantum Computing User Skills
Network should promptly use the already
existing possibilities of Investigate
quantum computing and these
technologies at high speed for applications
in the Making industry usable in a valueadding way. The network should perform
the following tasks:

\begin{itemize}
\item Identification of use cases in the user industry
and assessment of the implications for the
respective Industry or the respective market
\item rapid deployment of a low-threshold Access
to quantum computers and quantum inspired
hardware for research and industry, initially
on the basis of internationally available
Quantum computing systems
\item establishment of an independent assessment
competence for the user industry, the
questions about Performance, added value,
development effort, trends, etc. answered
\item Provision of methodological knowledge,
optimization of software algorithms and
creation of Development tools for quantum
computing applications and the creation of a
corresponding one User platform including
the cloud environment for access to the
quantum computers
\item Cooperative implementation of
practical pilot projects as a basis for
the development of related Business
models by user companies
\end{itemize}

\item Competence network quantum infrastructure\\\\
The competence network quantum infrastructure is supposed to
the infrastructure integrated in the hubs such as the production
of superconducting chips, atom trap chips, quantum photonics
and specialized Coordinate measurement environments and
merge them into an overarching measure. The network
has three main goals:

\begin{itemize}
\item Cross-hub coordination of infrastructure and their
adaptation to the specific quantum technology
requirements and identification missing system-critical
infrastructure and its Supplement or substitution in Europe
by establishing standards
\item Establishing uniform and open access models, for example
in the form of “Open Innovation and Testing Labs “or
cooperative technology parks with staff for the operation of
the systems and Manufacture of prototypes according to
specification in order to Start-ups, SMEs and researchers
have easy access to high-investment infrastructure enable
\item Establishment of a platform for a thematic and
Interdisciplinary community at the interface between
manufacturing and measurement technology, Universities,
research institutions and Industry - especially to the others
Quantum technology topics
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\newpage

\textbf{Competence network quantum education}\\\\
The competence network quantum education aims to
Coordinate and merge educational activities of the
hubs. The certification of educational offers
and the provision of high quality teaching materials
set quality and quality criteria and create networking.
The four main goals are:\\\\

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Training of specialists} through new
interdisciplinary training structures at
universities
\item \textbf{Acquisition of skills and further training} for
Industry and business through the mediation of
specific expertise and a realistic one assessment
competence
\item \textbf{Creating acceptance} in society through Public
relations and transparent information on the
potentials and limits of the Quantum
technologies especially in the context of school
education. This should include the Developing
negative emotions such as fears and avoid
uncertainties.
\item \textbf{Establishment of guidelines} and rules for
technology assessment of quantum technologies
through stakeholder dialogue with research,
business and politics
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Umbrella organization: Germans Quantum
Community (DQG)}

A lean and unbureaucratic umbrella organization should
be cross-hub and cross-competence networks ensure the
implementation of the overall strategy, by:

\begin{itemize}
\item advises and supports the public sector in the
implementation of the road-map,
\item a cross-departmental competitive process orchestrated, in
which they are responsible for all procurement and
evaluation issues through internationally recognized Experts
from science and Industry is advised,
\item by the Strategy Advisory Board described below
Evaluated progress of the funded hubs and competence
networks, corrective measures recommends and a
gradual focus on few promising hubs and contained
therein Carries out approaches,
\item initiates the creation of missing structures and
\item the coordination and cooperation between the Hubs and
the competence networks.
\end{itemize}

This requires an independent, competency-based
target structure, consisting of:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Supervisory board:} The federal ministries
themselves assume a supervisory function. The
supervisory board appoints the strategy advisory
board. It takes place no influence on the
content.
\item \textbf{Strategy Advisory Board:} The Advisory Board
consists of national and European,
internationally designated Experts from science
and Business. He has the strategic competence
to control the structure formation, tenders for
to recommend further strategic projects of the
hubs and competence networks, the scientific
and technical progress against the background
of the international state of research to evaluate,
overarching issues in To take up the area of IP
management to secure the formation of resilient
value chains and a global control function of the
activities of the take over hubs and competence
networks.
\item \textbf{Hub and Competence Network Association:}
The Association is made up of representatives
and representatives of the hubs and competence
networks. In cooperation with the Strategy
Advisory Board, it promotes the necessary
synergies, including through the Participation
of own representatives in the Strategy Advisory
Board, but to avoid Conflicts of interest without
a decision-making role within the umbrella
organization.
\item Office: The office supports the operational
implementation by those involved Federal
Ministries, accompanied the measures and
supports the strategy advisory board.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Financial instruments}
The organization proposed here is immediately with
existing instruments can be implemented to then after an
initial start-up phase in the longer term to be consolidated.\\\\

In the first step, the hubs and competence networks are set
up in a competitive process selected for funding. One is
planned \textbf{integrated promotion of scientific and industrial
actors together with selected European partners}. For this
are in a certain way Provision of earmarked funds in the
hubs. The award of the projects is proposed within the hub.\\\\

Role model for the flexibility in the concrete
implementation are existing examples such as the Clusters
of Excellence of DFG or the top clusters of the BMBF. This
requires first an adaptation of the existing financing
instruments and later the development dedicated
instruments. The entrepreneurial risk for industry and
especially for startups should according to the proximity to
industrialization and the development risk through \textbf{adapted funding rates} must be
taken into account. In addition, the state should use the
instrument of public procurement by awarding research and
development contracts Use protection for particularly highrisk work.\\\\

In addition, there are opportunities for \textbf{public Private
partnerships (PPP)} at the hub level implemented. This also
includes the possibilities for mixed financing with private
financing sources such as venture capital (Venture capital).\\\\


In addition, measures such as \textbf{start-up grants / EXIST
programs} and financial support are to be provided
the willingness to found start-ups for the establishment and
maintenance of the patent portfolio
promote the quantum computing ecosystem.

\section{Expand competencies, components make available, intellectual property protection}
% an image goes here...
\begin{multicols}{2}
\subsection{Strategic structure of Components}
The analysis under "Challenges and Solutions" shows: Germany is currently unable to
central elements of a quantum computer without
To develop or even to develop suppliers and the short-term
purchase of components from European or non-European
manufacturers
to produce. To change this, follow these steps
necessary

\begin{itemize}
\item Identification of the system-relevant components and
most important producers in Germany and Europe
and the decision as to which of these components are
critical to the system and must therefore be developed
promptly in Germany or Europe
\item Incentives for research and development system-relevant
components
\item any protection of the relevant IP
\item System integration or commercialization by start-ups,
existing SMEs or Large corporations
\end{itemize}
Dealing with system-critical, neutral or
trivial components must be regulated in a binding manner
be to in Germany and Europe sovereignty
to be able to achieve.
\begin{itemize}
\item System-critical components: System-critical
components should be manufactured in Germany
if possible, but they can also be manufactured in
Europe will. If this is not yet possible, you can they
are temporarily bought in (under clear defined
rules for non-European suppliers). At the same
time, the hubs have to set up a roadmap that 
describes how their own production is established or existing
actors for production of the components are to be incentivized.
\item \textbf{Neutral components:} Neutral components should come from
Europe, but they can too outside of Europe. Should it do not
make sense these components in Europe to produce its own
production based on If patents are not possible or alternative
technologies are not promising, partnerships should be
formed.
\item \textbf{Trivial components} are also allowed in the long term be
purchased from non-European countries. Trivial components
are those that are not critical for the manufacture of the
quantum computer or for which there are alternatives too Loss
of a producer due to, for example, export restrictions.

\end{itemize}

The components are divided into three categories in
the hubs
or competence networks and must be coordinated
with the DQG Strategy Advisory Board
to be in the parent
Quantum computing strategy
Germany and Europe to be classified.\\\\

\subsubsection{Objective} 
It must be the goal in Germany/Europe to achieve sovereignty and to
develop and/or to develop the
necessary talents keep. This should be
done by:

\begin{itemize}
\item stronger interlocking of Hardware
and software development in
situations that Promise
advantages. There should be
interfaces between application
software as well as hardware and
firmware are defined to to enable
long-term independent
development of application
software.
\item Independence from non-European manufacturers for systemcritical components. 
These should be in Germany, but can also
be made in Europe.
\item Establishment of long-term partnerships with component
manufacturers from Europe and Europe Countries

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Recommendations for action}

Deficits must especially be scalable in the areas Hardware
development, software development, system integration, IP
generation and competence building /-conservation be
compensated.

\textbf{Structure of system-relevant components in
Germany / Europe}
\begin{itemize}
\item Identification, deficit analysis and
classification of system-relevant components
through hubs / Competence networks in
cooperation with the Strategy Advisory Board
of DQG
\item Development of the production of system-relevant
components in the hubs / competence networks (with
Potential for spin-off) in Germany:
\begin{itemize}
\item Dedicated orders to industry or research
institutions to focus on To incentivize
quantum technologies and ensure
economic profitability
\item Focus on business development /
exploitation strategies
\end{itemize}
\item Establishing a cooperation with European Producers of
system-relevant components and non-European producers
for trivial ones Components and establishment of guidelines
for working with international Manufacturers
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Strategic structure of Competencies\\\\}
To meet the foreseeable high future demand to ensure skilled workers have structures for
interdisciplinary training and education as well Building competencies are created. Important
is primarily the further training of actors in industry and
business, in particular of
Decision-makers. Currently missing
it despite largely existing technological
Basic skills and components of staffing and scaling skills for
the transition from basic research to application.\\\\

\textbf{Objective\\\\}

The aim is to find the necessary talent in Germany build,
recruit, and keep. This works through the targeted
development of competencies for the development of
quantum hardware, components, quantum information
theory and quantum algorithms, for software, applications
and for System integration.\\\\

\textbf{Recommendations for action\\\\}
We recommend building talent and
Coordinated competencies in Germany / Europe
through the competence network quantum education
(see page 26) by the following measures:
\end{multicols}
\onecolumn

\newpage
\twocolumn
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Creation of interdisciplinary university Quantum
technology centers} beyond the usual Faculty boundaries
through additional professorships and research groups, special
course and Courses offered at universities and (subject)
Universities, training of doctoral candidates in Graduate
schools as well as training and further education by teachers as
multipliers
\item \textbf{Targeted exchange and transfer of know-how from science
to industry} by networking universities and research
institutions with industry. this happens for example through
shared use of the “quantum infrastructure” competence
network, the establishment of endowed professorships and
flexible ones Mobility programs between universities and
industry ("Industry sabbaticals") as well as the Incentivizing
start-ups to be built up, for example through quantum
computing entrepreneur study modules.
\end{itemize}
\section{Intellectual Property (IP)}
An overarching strategy on intellectual property is intended
to promote the position of Germany and Europe in the
Strengthen the race for the quantum computer. Europe
currently has 797 patents (excluding UK with 376),
410 of them in Germany, far behind the USA
1,990 or China with 5,164 patents (as of 2020
including patents up to and including 2018). A
strengthening of the IP position is therefore
essential to be a serious candidate on
to be able to participate in worldwide competition.\\\\

In addition, due to the complexity of the quantum
computer, successful implementation in Germany and
Europe is not through individual companies, but
expected in close cooperation with several industrial
partners together with research. An IP environment
is therefore necessary for both the cooperation
as well as the generation of IP promoted.\\\\


In order to achieve this, favorable framework conditions are
required for an increased transfer of knowledge
from research to industry to promotion
of IP generation and the simplification of cooperation
within Germany / Europe.

\subsubsection{Recommendations for action to strengthen the IP
position Germany and Europe}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf {IP regulations for startups\\\\}
Objective: a uniform spin-off policy from the
Science in Industry.
\begin{itemize}
\item Standardization and acceleration of IP transfers from
universities and research institutes to the industry
\item Incentivization of risk capital-based investments through
uniformly regulated exclusive Use of the IP by founders or
transfer to start-ups on fair terms. Technology sovereignty
must here guaranteed.
\item Spin-off support through the existing ecosystem of
incubators and accelerators
\item Orientation of existing infrastructures such as TechTransfer
offices at universities to international ones Models to enable
quick and easy transfer
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Freedom to operate and patent monitoring\\\\}
Goal: a comprehensive picture of the patent landscape
of quantum computing to get an overview of systemcritical patents.
\begin{itemize}
\item Task of the respective hub or respectively Competence
network
\item Consideration of the patent situation in the strategic
promotion of research and development. Identification of
where it makes sense alternative approaches need to be
explored and where to work with existing ones Is
inevitable for patent holders.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Patent pool\\\\}
Objective: to simplify cooperation between several patent
holders.
\begin{itemize}
\item In order to prevent blockages between different market
participants, a license-free or a licensed patent pool can be
established. Such patent pools are basically also for users
open outside Germany or Europe.
\item The exact execution of a patent pool must be individual
and in coordination with the antitrust law take place. The
pros and cons of such a patent pool must therefore be
carefully weighed up on a case-by-case basis.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Standardization\\\\}
Goal: Set standards from Europe in the quantum domain,
to strengthen the position in the worldwide race and
to benefit from existing structures.
\begin{itemize}
\item For efficient commercialization and worldwide
Positioning is important as early as possible To initiate
standardization processes. It is there makes sense to
participate in existing standardization organizations. These
are along with the experts from the hubs and Competence
networks are able to set such standards to establish.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
