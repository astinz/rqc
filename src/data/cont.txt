ROADMAP QUANTUM COMPUTING

[[SEC_0]]
Preface

[[SEC0_P0]]
Quantum technology has enormous potential for science, economy and society.
Quantum computing is of particular importance here: It is not just a fascinating
idea to solve tasks in the near future that even the most powerful
supercomputers fail to solve today. It is also a “must do” for a leading
technology location. For our high-tech industry, access to this technology can
be essential.

[[SEC0_P1]]
Quantum computers offer the potential to simulate highly complex systems for
the development of new types of batteries or for research into medical active
ingredients. In addition, quantum computers can enable far-reaching increases in
efficiency in numerous relevant applications, from the optimization of traffic
flows or production processes to model calculations in climate research.

[[SEC0_P2]]
It is therefore obvious that quantum technology is associated with enormous
dynamics in the global innovation competition. Germany and Europe are
called upon to significantly intensify their efforts in the coming years. Dealing
with the subject of quantum computing is definitely a question of
technological sovereignty in global competition with strong competitors,
especially in Asia and the USA.

[[SEC0_P3]]
What Germany can do is concentrate on its strengths and strategically develop
them. Perhaps the most important strength lies in an integrated landscape of
science and industry with large and small companies. Hardly anywhere else in the
world does such a closely interlinked chain exist, from basic research to the
development of key technology in many "hidden champions" through to
industrial application. However, we must not rest on that. Above all, we must
increase the speed and consistency with which research results are brought onto
the market. With full awareness of the existing advantages of the “German way”,
there is still a certain “German dilemma” in terms of technology transfer.

[[SEC0_P4]]
With this in mind, a council of experts from research and industry came together
and for the first time presented a broad-based road map on quantum technology.
We want to outline the common path and set a signal for an even closer, marketoriented alliance of business, science and politics. It is a truism: If we want to
attract the best minds and bring strong teams together in the global competition
with some state-supported actors, we need attractive, high-performance
structures - and action from a single source.
The challenges we face are therefore enormous. But we are now on our way and
bring together players from different industries who are committed to a goal with
major implications for the German economy. In this context, we would like to
thank the responsible ministries for their trust in and support of this initiative.

Executive Summary

[[SEC1_P0]]
The first quantum computers are already able to cope with simple tasks, and a multitude of
The company sees great economic potential in this area. This potential ranges from efficient
algorithms for applications through components to the construction and operation of complete systems.
Worldwide hasthe competition between the various technology platforms began. Here pioneers have established
themselves mainly due to the advances made by companies from North America. The winner on however, the
long term is not yet certain. To turn Germany into a worldwide one in the field of quantum computing to bring a
leading position and, together with its European partners, technological sovereignty in order to guarantee longterm, it is important to bundle forces now and to drive forward the system integration of selected technology
platforms in a focused manner.

[[SEC1_P1]]
Our goals:

[[SEC1_I0]]
short-term: create low-threshold access to today's
technology; a comprehensive ecosystem and focused
structures in five years build up. The milestone: an
internationally competitive quantum computer with at
least 100 individually controllable qubits. The system
should be scalable to at least 500 qubits.

[[SEC1_I1]]
medium term: demonstrate a quantum advantage for
practical applications in five to ten years. After ten
years, we want to be at the forefront of international
competition with superior technology.

[[SEC1_I2]]
Long-term: Provide an error-corrected system for
solving a universal class of problems in ten to fifteen
years. We want to achieve broad benefits for the economy
and society in this way.

[[SEC1_P2]]
The expert advice comes after a detailed analysis
the actual situation to the result that Germany over
excellent academic skills as well
a wealth of potential users of the technology
but today there is no single actor
and there is also no scientific association that
the development of a quantum computer system
could take over. The competencies are distributed
and there are gaps in scalable hardware development,
system integration, and the software stack
and the IP generation. Further challenges are
educational measures for development
and maintaining competence in business and science.
There are also deficits in terms of availability
digital and technological infrastructure and it
the instruments and framework conditions for
rapid technology transfer from research
into industry.

[[SEC1_P3]]
In order to move forward here as
quickly as possible, the Expert Council
recommends:

[[SEC1_I3]]
the immediate competitive build-up of Hubs and
competence networks. Companies we have to involve
them right from the start in order to guarantee the
necessary economic orientation and create incentives
for private investment. Universities and research
institutions must also act as scientific experts be
integrated. Hubs have the vertical one Building a
quantum computing system from technology
platforms to software to the goal. Hubs are semiautonomous and therefore agile even medium-term
goals against which they are measured will. Achieving
these own goals serves as a Based on a further focus
on the most promising hubs or technology platforms
after approx. Five years. Goes along with it an
increasing focus in the medium term for system
integration with construction of the corresponding
Infrastructure.
